# Search Application

This application has two given section namely:

 - Normal Search (Single Threaded)
 - Parallel Search (Multi Threaded)

#### Normal Search
Runs upon a single thread and processing takes place sequentially one by one.

#### Parallel Search
Runs upon multiple threads and processing takes place in a parallel way. Which means it is looping through all items at once without waiting for the previous item to complete.

#### Differences
The execution of Parallel Search is faster than Normal Search,as Parallel Search executes in different threads and takes less time compared to Normal Search.
